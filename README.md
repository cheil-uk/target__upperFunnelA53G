- optimisation test for upper funnel promo and finance journey enhancement

## Project setup

Simple Gulp, Sass and JS boilerplate

## Project description

1. npm install (if errors occur use n to switch node versions to version 11.0.0) - https://www.npmjs.com/package/n
2. Run the Gulp command.
3. Paste main.js from /build into console

## Background:

This is similar test activity to https://log.cheileu.com/browse/UKOT-272 where we surface double card on the PF for S21. We would like to repeat similar test activity for the latest New Fold3 and new flip.

## Research Questions:

How can we use the latest design component on PF (double card design) more effectively to improve the purchasing flow on COM?
How can we use the latest design component (double card design) more effectively to communicate some of the key offers on PF pages?
Key objectives:

Expose some of the key offers more effectively in upper funnel for Smartphones product ranges.
Develop a design system to surface some of the key generic offers.
Expose the phones contract as a way of purchasing on the latest component to encourage more customers to consider purchasing their phones directly.
Hypotheses:

Surfacing some of the offers within the content of the latest PF pages should increase the overall customersâ€™ engagement and encourage more customers to take out the offer.. We would know this is true when we see a significant improvement in overall CVR funnelled from this PF.

Exposing a phone contract as a module within the latest PF content should improve the volume of visits to the phones contract landing page. This would eventually improve the current browsing experience for devices available on contract and would encourage more customers to purchase smartphones directly from COM.

## When do we want to deliver?

We would like to focus on the launch rather than pre-order.

## Anything outstanding?

We need to make sure the overall copy and design tasks are completed. We would like to get this test live by the end of Sprint 36.
